I am a first-year MSCS student at UIUC, fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~jiaxuan/">Prof. Jiaxuan You</a>. I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from the School of EECS, Peking University, in 2025.

Currently, my research interests primarily focus on <span style="color:rgb(62, 30, 176);">the application of LLMs, with an emphasis on the interaction between humans and LLMs</span>. Key areas of interest include:

- **LLM Personalization.** Developing lightweight LLM personalization frameworks that leverage interaction data to address challenges such as high computational costs and privacy concerns in existing methods.

- **Enhancing LLMs with Graphs.** Graphs can formalize entities with interconnected relationships, making them well-suited to enhance LLMs, which handle vast amounts of common knowledge and tackle complex semantic tasks.

- Beyond the above, I am also interested in exploring various directions within **the empirical aspects of evaluating and improving the interpretability, fairness, privacy, robustness, and reasoning capabilities of LLMs**, ultimately advancing their benefits to humanity.

<strong style="color: #FF5733;">Feel free (and please do!) to reach out if you have any questions, comments about my research, or anything you'd like to discuss or share with me!</strong>

<!-- - Where does the info. come from?: I am curious about (1) Connecting robotics to more scalable data source given the shared foundations between robotics and vision, Language semantics; (2) formulating and distilling the shared information in cross-embodiment, cross-environment and cross-quality robotic dataset.
- How to integrate diverse info.?: Compared to directly transfering perception into action in IL/RL's policies, humans reason about interactions through vision before making contact and then performing detailed adaptations with multi-modal (e.g. tactile and acoustic) perception. I am interested to explore when and how to integrate diverse information in robotics. -->
